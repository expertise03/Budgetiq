🧠 Budgetiq — Financial Freedom Begins Here
💬 "Financial literacy isn’t a luxury — it’s a necessity."

Budgetiq isn't just another budget tracker. It's a mission-driven app built to empower the financially underserved — especially women, homemakers, pensioners, divorcees, and widowers — to take charge of their finances with confidence.

Despite their pivotal roles in households and society, many women and senior citizens are still underrepresented in the world of investments, budgeting, and personal finance. Budgetiq is built with empathy and purpose to bridge that gap — offering a smart, simple, and dignified way to manage everyday money.

Why Budgetiq?
Many individuals — particularly women in non-salaried roles — are often overlooked when it comes to financial tools. With Budgetiq, we aim to:

📚 Promote financial literacy among women and the elderly
💪 Encourage independent decision-making in spending and saving
🌱 Build confidence in budgeting, planning, and eventually investing
🏠 Support homemakers, who manage entire households but are rarely counted as “earners”
💔 Help divorcees and widowers rebuild control over their financial lives

🛠️ Built With:-

⚛️ React + TypeScript

# Splitease- Smart AI-Powered Financial Management For Students

## Project Description
Splitease is an intelligent financial management platform built to tackle the complexity of personal finance through artificial intelligence. In today's fast-paced world, managing expenses, tracking spending patterns, and making informed financial decisions has become increasingly challenging. Splitease addresses these pain points by leveraging AI to transform complex financial data into actionable insights, providing users with a comprehensive yet intuitive financial management experience.

Our platform analyzes transaction patterns, predicts future expenses, and offers personalized recommendations tailored to each user's financial habits. With features ranging from automated receipt scanning to multi-currency support, BudgetIQ empowers users to take control of their financial health regardless of their financial literacy level.

## Why Splitease?
- **Financial Visibility Gap**: Most people lack clear insight into their spending patterns and financial health
- **Manual Tracking Burden**: Traditional expense tracking is time-consuming and error-prone
- **Financial Literacy Barrier**: Complex financial planning requires expertise most users don't possess
- **Language Accessibility**: Many financial tools lack support for Indian languages, limiting accessibility
- **Decision Support**: Users need contextual guidance for making better financial choices

## Features
